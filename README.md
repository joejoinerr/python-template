# Python template

A starter template for Python projects. Includes lots of useful tools and
configurations suitable for most Python projects.

## How to use

```bash
uvx copier copy --trust git@github.com:joejoinerr/python-template.git <your-directory>
```

This will ask you some questions about your project. It will then create the
project in the directory you specified, make an initial Git commit, install
dependencies, format the code and install the pre-commit hooks.
